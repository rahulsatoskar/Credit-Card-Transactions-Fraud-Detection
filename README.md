# Credit-Card-Transactions-Fraud-Detection
Data Engineering project using batch ingestion and ML pipeline to detect whether a transaction is false or not 

## Title
Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection using Batch Ingestion and Machine Learning Pipeline.

## Projectâ€™s function
As e-commerce and Fintech boom, these systems must be as robust as possible. In countries with high credit card usage, particularly the US credit card companies should be able to distinguish fraudulent vs genuine transactions in real time with high precision so that customers are not charged for fraudulent transactions.
This project will use a simulated credit card transaction dataset using Sparkov extracted using a Kaggle API using batch ingestion. A data pipeline will be used to process this data and suitable transformations on the data will be done. Finally, a machine learning pipeline will be used to classify a transaction as Fraudulent or Genuine. We will plot a confusion matrix and ROC curve and display performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC to see how well each of the machine learning models used is performing on our dataset.

## Dataset
This project will use a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraudulent transactions from the duration of 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers the credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.
